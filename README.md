# A headless countdown timer widget made with Flutter.

## Description

A headless countdown timer widget is a type of widget that operates without a traditional app interface. Instead of opening an app to interact with the timer, users can control and edit the countdown directly from their Android homescreen. This makes it convenient for quick access and adjustments, providing a seamless user experience. The widget can be customized to change the target time.

## Getting Started

Download the apk from the release section and install it on your Android device. Add the widget to your homescreen and the countdown starts. You can edit the target time by tapping on the widget.
